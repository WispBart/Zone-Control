# Zone Control
This project is part of the Fontys Game Design & Technology weekly dev challenge on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/wispbart).

We're making a multiplayer game in Unity inspired by the Starcraft map [Zone Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl94dsQtV1g).

We have very little time.
